All the backend work was done in the routes/index.js file. app.js just has some boilerplate code and hooks.
The frontend here has been built for production already, so the code can't be viewed here. I uploaded a separate repository where all the React code is contained. Here it is: https://github.com/ShaiPreter/Go-Integrations-Test-Frontend
